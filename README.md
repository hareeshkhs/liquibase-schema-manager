## Deploying Schema With Docker
- Set the Docker image
```shell script
docker login ghcr.io -u $username --password-stdin
docker pull ghcr.io/hareeshkhs/liquibase-schema-manager:$SM_TAG
```
- To deploy schemas, set the DB credentials and the schemas in the following command and execute 
```
docker run --name "$CONTAINER_NAME" \ 
-e AVAILABLE_SCHEMAS="v9/l0, v9/l1, v9/l2, v9/l3"
-e POSTGRES_HOST=HOST \ 
-e PORT=PORT \ 
-e POSTGRES_DB=DB_NAME \ 
-e POSTGRES_USER=USERNAME \ 
-e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=PASSWORD \ 
-e EMAIL_APP_PASSCODE=EMAIL_APP_PASSCODE \
ghcr.io/hareeshkhs/liquibase-schema-manager:$SM_TAG
```
- Check that the output of the following query matches `$SM_TAG`.
```
SELECT tag FROM db_logs.databasechangelog ORDER BY dateexecuted DESC LIMIT 1;
```
## Usage

### Local development setup
- Clone the remote reposity
```
git clone https://github.com/hareeshkhs/liquibase-schema-manager.git
```
- Create a sub-branch with name prefix as feature/{branch_name}, and checkout into the branch
```
git checkout -b feature/patient_table_change_020525
```

### Installing Requirements for Local Development
- Install the virtualenv
```
pip install virtualenv
```
- Create a virtual environment
```
python3 -m venv venv
```
- Activate the virtual environment and install requirements
```
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
### Configuring credentials
- Schema Manager retrieves config from environment variables or from a [.env](.env) file
- Required environment variables:
```
AVAILABLE_SCHEMAS="l0, l1, l2"              # list of schemas to deploy
POSTGRES_HOST=database_host                 # DB Host on which deployment is to happen
POSTGRES_DB=db_name                         # Name of the database on which deployment is to happen
PORT=5432                                   # DB Port
POSTGRES_USER=user_name                     # Username to login to the DB with
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=strong_password           # Password to login to the DB with
```

### Deploying a fresh schema locally
- Make sure schemas configured in `AVAILABLE_SCHEMAS` DO NOT exist on the database
- Make sure the user has the necessary privileges.
- Execute the following command to deploy the schemas
```shell script
python3 main.py
```
- Check that the schemas have been deployed.
- Check that the following tables exist in the database in the `public` schema
    - databasechangelog
    - databasechangeloglock 
- Check that the output of the following query matches `__version__` in [version.py](version.py)
```shell script
SELECT tag FROM db_logs.databasechangelog ORDER BY dateexecuted DESC LIMIT 1;
```

### Updating/changing the schema
- Create a new "changelog" file in the folder that corresponds to the schema you wish to update or change.
- This file contains the `ALTER/CREATE` SQL statements to update or change the schema.
- For example
```shell script
touch postgres/core/2025_05_02_15_45_00_patient_table_changes.sql
```
- Note the format of the name. It is `YYYY_MM_DD_HH_MM_SS_{Change_Title}.sql`
- Always put the latest date and time for the file name. If the file is committed and pushed to the repo at a later date, then rename the file name to match the date and time.
- The file extension must be `.sql`
- The file must begin with the following line:
```
--liquibase formatted sql
```
- The changeset tag must be of the form: `owner:id`
- Recommended `id` is [Unix Epoch Time](https://www.epochconverter.com/) in seconds at which the SQL is written.
- The changeset tag must be put for each SQL statement.
- If the SQL statements exceed more than one line, add a `splitStatements:false`
- For more help on creating changelog files, follow [here](https://docs.liquibase.com/concepts/basic/sql-format.html)
- Make sure to refer to tables, views, other entities with their full names, i.e. `"SCHEMA"."ENTITY_NAME"`
- Make sure schemas configured in `AVAILABLE_SCHEMAS` exist on the database
- Set the credentials of the test DB in [.env](.env)
- Execute the following command to upgrade the schemas:
```shell script
python3 main.py
```
- Check that the output of the following query on the test DB matches `__version__` in [version.py](version.py)
```
SELECT tag FROM db_logs.databasechangelog ORDER BY dateexecuted DESC LIMIT 1;
```
- Commit the changes made to a `feature/` branch and raise a merge request to `master`.

### Upgrading the schema
- Make sure schemas configured in `AVAILABLE_SCHEMAS` exist on the database
- Check that the following tables exist in the database in the `db_logs` schema
    - databasechangelog
    - databasechangeloglock 
- Note the output of the following query:
```
SELECT tag FROM db_logs.databasechangelog ORDER BY dateexecuted DESC LIMIT 1;
```
- Note the version described as `__version__` in [version.py](version.py)
- Execute the following command to upgrade the schemas:
```shell script
python3 main.py
```
- Check that the output of the following query matches `__version__` in [version.py](version.py)
```
SELECT tag FROM db_logs.databasechangelog ORDER BY dateexecuted DESC LIMIT 1;
```

### Adding a new schema
- Create a new folder with the name of the schema
- For example:
```shell script
mkdir postgres/merchant/core
```
- Follow the steps in [Updating/changing the schema](#updatingchanging-the-schema) to create a new changelog file in this folder
- The first two changesets should be:
```shell script
--changeset AUTHOR:ID splitStatements:false
CREATE SCHEMA core;

--changeset AUTHOR:ID splitStatements:false
SET SEARCH_PATH TO core;
```
- Follow the steps in [Updating/changing the schema](#updatingchanging-the-schema) to add more statements in the changelog file.
- Commit the changes made to a `feature/` branch and raise a merge request to `master`.
## Miscellaneous
### Checking the version of the schema on a database
- Check that the output of the following query matches `__version__` in [version.py](version.py)
```
SELECT tag FROM db_logs.databasechangelog ORDER BY dateexecuted DESC LIMIT 1;
```
